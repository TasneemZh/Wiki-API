JavaScript + Node.js + Express + MongoDB + RESTful

You can use **Robo 3T** instead of the hyper terminal `mongo` to interact with the databases in the GUI approach rather than the CLI one.

NOTE: Make sure to connect to the **Robo 3T** properly in order to reach your local databases.

Use **Postman** instead of writing a form in the HTML or URLs parameters in the HTTP. It is a very efficient method to test your RESTful code.
