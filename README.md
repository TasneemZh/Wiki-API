JavaScript + Node.js + Express + MongoDB + RESTful

You can use **Robo 3T** instead of the hyper terminal `mongo` to interact with the databases in the GUI approach rather than the CLI one.

NOTE: Make sure to connect to the **Robo 3T** properly in order to reach your local databases.

Use **Postman** instead of writing a form in the HTML or URLs parameters in the HTTP. It is a very efficient method to test your RESTful code.

-----------------

1- Use the HyperTerminal to enter the server by:

NOTE: **don't do the first bulleted step if you have installed nodemon before**

- Installing nodemon by typing `npm install -g nodemon` (Wherever you want^^)

- Moving to the directory where you cloned the project (Use cd)

- Typing `nodemon (app.js)`

NOTE: Specifying *app.js* after *nodemon* is **optional** since it is determined to be the main file in *package.JSON*

2 - Enter the URL: http://localhost:3000/articles **and** http://localhost:3000/articles/[article-name]

NOTE: the [article-name] parameter is case-sensitive and thus should be an exact match to the intended article title
